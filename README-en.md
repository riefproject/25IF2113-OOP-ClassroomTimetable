# üöÄ OOP Course Schedule Project - Polban 2025

Welcome to the Course Schedule Project repository! This project was created to fulfill an assignment for the **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** course at Politeknik Negeri Bandung.

This application is a simple Command-Line Interface (CLI) that allows users to view and search for course schedules based on existing data. It's simple, fast, and straight to the point!

## ‚ú® Cool Features

This application has several main features:

1.  **Draft-to-Active Entity Lifecycle**: Academic entities (Campus, Department, Study Program, Class, Student, Lecturer, Course) now have an `isActive` status. They start as 'draft' (`isActive=false`) and can only be activated if they meet strict hierarchical validation criteria (e.g., a Campus is only active if it has at least one active Department, and so on). This reflects a real-world workflow where entities must have valid dependencies to be considered 'operational'.
2.  **Strict Hierarchical Data Validation**: The system now enforces very strict validation when loading data. Child entities will not be created or added if their required parent entity is missing or invalid when data is read from CSVs. This ensures strong data integrity and reflects that "an educational institution cannot exist without students" and vice versa.
3.  **Search Schedule by Class**: Instantly view the complete schedule for a specific class. You can also filter by day, so you don't have to scroll endlessly.
4.  **View Class List**: Forgot your class code? No worries, there's a list of all available classes in the system.
5.  **Data Summary**: Curious about the lecturers or the courses offered? This feature displays a summary of lecturers, classes, and their students.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

This project is built with fundamental technologies, focusing on the application of OOP concepts:

-   **Java**: The primary language used, of course.
-   **OOP Principles**: Implements core concepts like *Encapsulation*, *Association*, and *Composition* to model entities such as Mahasiswa (Student), Dosen (Lecturer), and Jadwal (Schedule).
-   **No External Libraries**: Built purely with the standard Java Development Kit (JDK) to maximize understanding of the basics.

## üìÇ Project Structure

-   `src/`: Contains all the Java source code, organized into several packages:
    -   `app`: The application's entry point (Main.java).
    -   `model`: Classes that represent the data models (Lecturer, Student, Campus, Department, Study Program, etc.).
    -   `service`: Business logic, such as loading data from CSVs and search functionality.
-   `data/`: A collection of `.csv` files that act as the "database" for this application.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è A Note on Data

The data used in this project (`dosen.csv`, `mahasiswa.csv`, `jadwal.csv`, `matakuliah.csv`, `kampus.csv`, `jurusan.csv`, `prodi.csv`, `kelas_prodi.csv`, `matakuliah_prodi.csv`) is **real course data from Polban**. However, to protect privacy, **all personal identities, such as the names of lecturers and students, have been anonymized**. So, don't be surprised if you find some unique or funny names!

## üíª How to Run

Can't wait to try it out? Follow these steps:

1.  **Compile the Code**
    Open your terminal or command prompt, then run the command below from the project's root directory:

    ```bash
    # For Linux/macOS users
    ./build.sh

    # Or manually
    javac -d out src/id/ac/polban/**/*.java
    ```

2.  **Run the Application**
    Once compiled successfully, run the application with this command:

    ```bash
    # For Linux/macOS users
    ./run.sh

    # Or manually
    java -cp out id.ac.polban.app.Main
    ```

After that, an interactive menu will appear in your terminal. Enjoy!

## üì¶ Releases

The compiled JAR file (`AkademikByArief.jar`) will be uploaded to the [Releases](https://github.com/riefproject/25IF2113-OOP-ClassroomTimetable/releases) section of this repository with every update.
